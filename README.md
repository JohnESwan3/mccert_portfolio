# About This Project

This portfolio was made as a final project for my Media Communications Certifation at Full Sail University. The instructor suggested that we use something like Wordpress or a free website builder, but since I know how to do Web Development, I wanted to build it myself and improve my skills.
I built this project after spending a few weeks learning both Next.js and TypeScript, and figuring out the best ways to implement Sanity correctly while taking advantages of the features of Next.js was a pain but I landed on Incremental Static Regeneration to keep the CMS pages rendered on the server but able to be updated without reloading the whole application.

#### Sanity CMS
Sanity.io handles most of the content on the website.
